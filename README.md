# DotFiles

My dotfiles for my development environment.

## Setting up a new machine

1. Git clone this repo to the machine
2. Use the symlink-dotfiles.sh script to automatically create symlinks for the dotfiles in this directory. By default and overwrite whatever you may have in that directory. `bash symlink-dotfiles.sh`
