# DotFiles

My dotfiles for my development environment.

## Setting up a new machine

1. Git clone this repo to the machine
2. Use the symlink-dotfiles.sh script to automatically create symlinks for the dotfiles in this directory. By default and overwrite whatever you may have in that directory. `bash install.sh`

## Manual recommendations for Mac OS Terminal

- Set up `https://github.com/lysyi3m/macos-terminal-themes` with the `Arthur` Theme
- Make the terminal fontsize `16`
- Make the font `Roboto Mono for Powerline`
