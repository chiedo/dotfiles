# GitHub Codespaces

[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) provides cloud-hosted development environments for any activity - whether it's a long-term project, or a short-term task like reviewing a pull request. You can connect to Codespaces from Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio ([sign up for the Private Preview](https://github.com/features/codespaces/signup-vs)), or a browser-based editor that's accessible anywhere!

Additionally, GitHub Codespaces brings many of the benefits of DevOps, like repeatability and reliability, which have typically been reserved for production workloads, to development environments. However, GitHub Codespaces is also personalizable to allow developers to leverage the tools, processes and configurations that they have come to love and rely on - truly the best of both worlds!
